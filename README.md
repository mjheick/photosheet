# photosheet

Take a large scanned image that would contain images within it and extract out the images

# wtf

I have a flatbed scanner and a TON of old-timey developed photos. Instead of scanning each photo individually I decided to scan sets of photos and have whitespace between the photos.

Then I need a program to undo the work that I put forth, hence this program.

# Execution

This should be ezpz:

```
php -f photosheet.php [filename]
```

Output files would be [filename]-xxx.extension

Some will appear to be duplicates, others might be sub-photos in photos. Enough culling might've happenned, but notsureif.
